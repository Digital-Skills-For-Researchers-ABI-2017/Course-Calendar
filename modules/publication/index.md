# Publishing Reproducible Research


This module will introduce how to publish your research so that is reproducible. You now have the technical skills, and knowledge about sharing and livening, to do so. Reproducible research goes beyond ensuring open access to your research data. It calls for integrating your research output, data and work flow so that your research can be discovered, followed and reproduced by others. The degree by which scientific journals support publishing reproducible research varies considerably, we will explore how scientific journals have changed and the different publishing avenues that are not available.
