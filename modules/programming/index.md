# Introduction to programming with Python

This module will introduce you to programming, specifically with Python. Python is a very common language for scientific computing, there is a good chance if a collaborator of yours can program, they will know Python. Python comes with "batteries included", there are extensive libraries available for a wide range of functionality.  The skills you develop in this module will be valid to any programming language you might use in future, not just python.     




## Block 1 | Getting Started With Python

Getting started with Python. Assigning values to variables, control structures and storing data.

## Badges

1. ### Simple calculations using variables
  Perform basic scientific calculations such as changing from degrees Kelvin to degrees Celsius, using named variables and displaying the result 
  _Learning outcomes: a_


2. ### Loops and Conditional Statements
  Given a basic data set, loop through the data and check whether it is valid according to the criteria supplied.
  _Learning outcomes: b_


3. ### Arrays and lists
  Using indexing and slicing, can find the value and index of the minimum, maximum, and other simple operations, of different ranges within arrays and lists. 
  _Learning outcomes: c_


4. ### Creating and Composing Functions
  Create a simple function that performs a scientific calculation. Use this function in a new function [to  do something]
  _Learning outcomes: d_


5. ### Defensive Programming
  Given a simple function, can identify what pre and post conditions need to be tested for, and identify the invariants in the function. 
  _Learning outcomes: d, e_


6. ### Test Driven Development
  Given the outline of a simple function, you can create a series of tests that check function validity, corner cases and faulty/incorrect input.
  _Learning outcome: e_
