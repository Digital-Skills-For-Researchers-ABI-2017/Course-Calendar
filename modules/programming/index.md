# Programming

This module will introduce you to programming using Python, a popular language for use in scientific computing. There are many code libraries built on top of Python, allowing you to extend its functionality for a wide range of purposes.  The skills you develop in this module will also be relevant in any other programming languages you may use in future.


## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this module you should be able to:

-  Understand and use basic control structures in Python
-  Create simple Python programs using named variables and control structures
-  Debug and create tests for basic Python programs.
- Understand why testing is used in software development. Write unit tests for functions.

  [&raquo; Assessment Details](badges/looper.html)

3. ### [Composer | _Functions_](badges/composer.html)
  ![Functions Badge](badges/images/composer.png)
  Using Python, write a script which uses a function to improve the code structure and clarity.
  [&raquo; Assessment Details](badges/composer.html)

4. ### [Input and Output](badges/input-output.html)
  ![Input Output Badge](badges/images/input-output.png)
  Using Python, write a script to ask the user for a file to process, then save the program's output to another file.
  [&raquo; Assessment Details](badges/input-output.html)

5. ### Defender | _Defensive Programming_ (coming soon)
  ![Defender Badge](badges/images/defender.png) 
  Given a simple function, refactor the code to increase function stability by addressing edge cases and faulty or incorrect input.


6. ### The Stig | _Test Driven Development_ (coming soon)
  ![TDD Badge](badges/images/tdd.png)
  Use the Test Driven Development process of "red, green, refactor" to design, test and implement a function.
  

7. ### Safety Net | _Error Handling_ (coming soon)
  ![TDD Badge](badges/images/tdd.png)
  Increase the stability of a piece of code by catching and handling common errors, then providing user feedback rather than exiting.
