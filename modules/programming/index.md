# Introduction to programming with Python

This module will introduce you to programming, specifically with Python. Python is a very common language for scientific computing, there is a good chance if a collaborator of yours can program, they will know Python. Python comes with "batteries included", there are extensive libraries available for a wide range of tasks.  The skills you develop in this module will be valid to any programming language you might use in future, not just python.
