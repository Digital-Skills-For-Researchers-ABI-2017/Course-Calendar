title: Python Programming

introduction: This module will introduce you to programming using Python, a popular language for use in scientific computing. There are many code libraries built on top of Python, allowing you to extend its functionality for a wide range of purposes.  The skills you develop in this module will also be relevant in any other programming languages you may use in future.

learning-outcomes:

  - Understand and use basic control structures in Python
  - Create simple Python programs using named variables and control structures
  - Debug and create tests for basic Python programs.
  - Understand why testing is used in software development. Write unit tests for functions.
