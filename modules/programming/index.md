# Programming

This module will introduce you to programming using Python, a popular language for use in scientific computing. There are many code libraries built on top of Python, allowing you to extend its functionality for a wide range of purposes.  The skills you develop in this module will also be relevant in any other programming languages you may use in future.


## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this module you should be able to:

-  Understand and use basic control structures in Python
-  Create simple Python programs using named variables and control structures
-  Debug and create tests for basic Python programs.
- Understand why testing is used in software development. Write unit tests for functions.

1. ### [Input and Output](badges/input-output.html)
  ![Input Output Badge](badges/images/input-output.png)
  Using Python, write a script to ask the user for a file to process, then save the program's output to another file.

2. ### [Looper](badges/lists-loops.html)
  ![Lists Loops Badge](badges/images/lists-loops.png)
  Using Python, write a script which constructs a list and then loops over the items to find a summarised result.

3. ### [Booleans and Conditionals](badges/conditionals.html)
  ![Booleans Conditionals Badge](badges/images/conditionals.png)
  Write a program which runs some conditional functionality based on a property of a given object.
  [&raquo; Assessment Details](badges/conditionals.html)


4. ### [Composer](badges/functions.html)
  ![Functions Badge](badges/images/functions.png)
  Using Python, write a script which uses a function to improve the code structure and clarity.
  [&raquo; Assessment Details](badges/functions.html)

5. ### Defensive Programming
  ![Defender Badge](images/badges/badge.png)
  Given a simple function, can identify what pre and post conditions need to be tested for, and identify the invariants in the function. 
  _Learning outcomes: d, e_


6. ### Test Driven Development
  ![TDD Badge](images/badges/badge.png)
  Given the outline of a simple function, you can create a series of tests that check function validity, corner cases and faulty/incorrect input.
  _Learning outcome: e_
