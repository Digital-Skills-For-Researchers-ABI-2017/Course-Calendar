title: Programming

introduction: This module will introduce you to programming using Python, a popular language for use in scientific computing. There are many code libraries built on top of Python, allowing you to extend its functionality for a wide range of purposes.  The skills you develop in this module will also be relevant in any other programming languages you may use in future.

learning-outcomes:

  - Understand and use basic control structures in Python
  - Create simple Python programs using named variables and control structures
  - Debug and create tests for basic Python programs.
  - Understand why testing is used in software development. Write unit tests for functions.

    slug: defender
    description: Given a simple function, refactor the code to increase function stability by addressing edge cases and faulty or incorrect input.

  - serious-name: Test-Driven Development
    fun-name: The Stig
    slug: the-stig
    description: Use the Test Driven Development process of "red, green, refactor" to design, test and implement a function.

  - serious-name: Error Handling
    fun-name: Safety Net
    slug: safety-net
    description: Increase the stability of a piece of code by catching and handling common errors, then providing user feedback rather than exiting.
