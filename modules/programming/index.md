# Programming

This module will introduce you to programming using Python, a popular language for use in scientific computing. There are many code libraries built on top of Python, allowing you to extend its functionality for a wide range of purposes.  The skills you develop in this module will also be relevant in any other programming languages you may use in future.

## Badges

1. ### Simple calculations using variables
  ![IO Badge](images/badges/badge.png)
  Perform basic scientific calculations such as changing from degrees Kelvin to degrees Celsius, using named variables and displaying the result 
  _Learning outcomes: a_


2. ### Loops and Conditional Statements
  ![Decisions Badge](images/badges/badge.png)
  Given a basic data set, loop through the data and check whether it is valid according to the criteria supplied.
  _Learning outcomes: b_


3. ### Arrays and lists
  ![List Badge](images/badges/badge.png)
  Using indexing and slicing, can find the value and index of the minimum, maximum, and other simple operations, of different ranges within arrays and lists. 
  _Learning outcomes: c_


4. ### Creating and Composing Functions
  ![Functions Badge](images/badges/badge.png)
  Create a simple function that performs a scientific calculation. Use this function in a new function [to  do something]
  _Learning outcomes: d_


5. ### Defensive Programming
  ![Defender Badge](images/badges/badge.png)
  Given a simple function, can identify what pre and post conditions need to be tested for, and identify the invariants in the function. 
  _Learning outcomes: d, e_


6. ### Test Driven Development
  ![TDD Badge](images/badges/badge.png)
  Given the outline of a simple function, you can create a series of tests that check function validity, corner cases and faulty/incorrect input.
  _Learning outcome: e_
