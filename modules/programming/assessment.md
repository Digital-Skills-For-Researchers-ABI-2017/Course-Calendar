# Introduction to Programming | Assessment
[View Schedule for Week One](index.html)


## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this module you should be able to:

- a. Create and manipulate variables
- b. Create simple functions 
- c. Use loops and conditional statements to control program flow
- d. Load, process and save data  



## Badges

1. **Simple calculations using variables**
Perform basic scientific calculations such as changing from degrees Kelvin to degrees Celsius, using named variables and displaying the result 
_Learning outcomes: a_


2. **Loops and Conditional Statements**
Given a basic data set, loop through the data and check whether it is valid according to the criteria supplied.
_Learning outcomes: b_


3. **Arrays and lists**
_Learning outcomes: c_


4. **Creating Functions**
Create a document describing the purpose of the project and what you intend to produce.
_Learning outcomes: d_


5. **Defensive Programming**
Given a simple function, can identify what pre and post conditions need to be tested for, and identify the invariants in the function. 
_Learning outcomes: d, e_


6. **Test Driven Development**
Given the outline of a simple function, you can create a series of tests that check function validity, corner cases and faulty/incorrect input.
_Learning outcome: e_
