- b. Create README files outlining project purpose, data collection processes, naming conventions 
- c. Store data (where possible) in an open, readable format that is logically structured. 
- d. Understand the different data storage options available and their advantages and disadvantages.
- e. Create meta data for scientific data that follows common standards. Understand the prupose of meta data; how it aids in discoverability and describing data.
- f. Understand issues around data sensitivity, and how to mitigate and manage these issues  


## Badges


1. **File naming and organisation**
Given a list of poorly and inconsistently named files, come up with a improved naming convention. Create a folder structure for the files and move them into it.  
_Learning outcomes: a_


2. **Create a "README.text**
Given a simple scientific scenario with experimental data, create a README.txt file.
_Learning outcomes: b_


3. **Creating meta data**
Using the same scenario as Badge 2, create meta data using [STANDARD X]
_Learning outcomes: c_


4. **Intellectual and ethical issues w.r.t data**
Using same scenario as Badges 2 and 3, identify how the raw data might need to be collected (anonymization), stored for a length of time/destroyed after study as well as limitations around sharing for IP reasons.  
_Learning outcomes: d_
