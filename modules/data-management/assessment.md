# Data Management | Assessment
[View Schedule for Week One](index.html)


## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this module you should be able to:

- a. Create a file naming scheme and organise data in an accesible and logical manner
- b. Create README files oulining project purpose, data collection processes, naming conventions 
- c. Store data (where possible) in an open, readable format that is logically structured. Understand the different data sotrage options available and their advantages and disadvantages.
- d. Create meta data for scientific data that follows commmon standards
- e. Understand issues around data senstivity, and how to mitigate and manage these issues  




## Badges

1. **File naming and organisation**
Given a list of poorly and inconsistenyly named files, come up with a improved naming convention. Create a folder stucture for the files and move them into it.  
_Learning outcomes: a_


2. **Create a "README.text**
Given a simple scientific scenario with experimental data, create a README.txt file.
_Learning outcomes: b_


3. **Arrays and lists**
_Learning outcomes: c_


4. **Creating Functions**
Create a document describing the purpose of the project and what you intend to produce.
_Learning outcomes: d_


5. **Defensive Programming**
Given a simple function, can identify what pre and post conditions need to be tested for, and identify the invariants in the function. 
_Learning outcomes: d, e_


6. **Test Driven Development**
Given the outline of a simple function, you can create a series of tests that check function validity, corner cases and faulty/incorrect input.
_Learning outcome: e_
