# Shell

This module will introduce the shell, and how it can be used to perform data management and analysis as part of your workflow. The shell is a way of accessing different functions your computer provides. You interact with the shell through the use of the command line, typing out tasks you want your pc to perform. The command line offers a powerful and succint way of automating data processing.
