# Shell

This module will introduce the shell, and how it can be used to perform data management and analysis as part of your workflow. The shell is a way of accessing different functions your computer provides. You interact with the shell through the use of the command line, typing out tasks you want your pc to perform. The command line offers a powerful and succint way of automating data processing. 





## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this module you should be able to:

- a. Navigate through a file system and list files within different folders using the commmand line
- b. Create, move, and delete files using the command line
- c. Run programs and open files from the command line
- d. Combine commands, such as filters,  using pipes to perform more complex data processing tasks 
- e. Reason about how to automate simple tasks using the command line.

## Group | Stats

Idea: gather stats on your project using commands you've learned. Document the command and the output of the command. Compose a script that outputs these current stats for you project.

This Hacky Hour should be used to start managing and organising your data using the skills and concepts you learnt in the Data Management module, using the command line where possible.

## Badges


1. ### Navigating the file system
  ![Navigator Badge](images/badges/badge.png)
  Given a unfamiliar set of folders and files, you are able to navigate from one folder to another folder in a different heirarchy, using **cd**
  _Learning outcomes: a_


2. ### Creating, moving and deleting files
  ![Organiser Badge](images/badges/badge.png)
  Given a unfamiliar set of folders and files, you are able to copy, move and delete files from different folders.
  _Learning outcomes: c_


3. ### Pipes and Filters
  ![Pied Piper Badge](images/badges/badge.png)
  Given a folder with a set of files, you are able to find all files of a certain type, i.e ".dat", filter those files based on a criteria such as the number of lines in a file, and write the resultng list of files into a text file.
  _Learning outcomes: d_


4. ### Shell Scripts
  ![Born to Shell Badge](images/badges/badge.png)
  Create a shell script that takes a file name as a variable,
  performs some calculations on the file data, such as number of rows, and prints the result to the consolse.
  _Learning outcomes: d, e_


5. ### Regular Expressions
  ![Pattern Matcher Badge](images/badges/badge.png)
  Create a shell script that uses a regular expression to find all files named using a certain pattern, rename those files using a different pattern, and save the list of changed files to a text file.
  _Learning outcome: e_
