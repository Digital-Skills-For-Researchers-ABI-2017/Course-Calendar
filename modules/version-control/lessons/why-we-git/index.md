title: Why Use Git

---

## We Use Git to...

### Back Up

Using Git, we can "commit" changes to our project history. Each time we make a describable change, we can give that change a short description and store it as a backup point.

Without Git, we have to copy-paste our project folder to create a backup version. Backing up with Git allows us to have many versions of our project stored in the background, allowing us to easily focus on the current version and not accidentally work on an older version. 


### Track Changes Over Time

Using Git to track the evolution of our project means we can always look back at how the project has changed over time. This may be helpful in a long-running project if you want to access an old version of your project which uses a different file format or a different operating system.

Without Git, we would have to store a separate copy of important version of our project, ahead of time. With Git you can choose any day or time in the past and access your project exactly as it was at that point.




## We Use GitHub to... 


### Back Up Online

If something happens to our computer or hard drive, there is another copy of our project stored online which we can copy and continue working on.

Every time we push our changes to GitHub, we're creating a backup on a completely different location. The likelihood of both GitHub _and_ our computer being destroyed simultaneously is super low, so this is a very smart way to back up.


### Share

We should always consider creating a publicly accessible copy of our work. Someone else may have a use for our whole project, or even just pieces of our project.

By publishing and sharing what we've done, we are enabling a collaborative community where the cycle of creating, reusing and sharing is complete.


### Get Feedback

GitHub offers a fantastic set of tools for communicating around projects. Other users can log bugs they've found, comment on code structure, say thank you, or share their personal experience using the project including what worked for their purposes and what didn't.


### Collaborate

Other users can copy your code and make some changes, then send those changes back to you as suggested updates.

Sometimes projects are entirely collaborative, and not really owned by a single person. Groups of people will self-organise into "owners" and "contributors" of a project for a period of time. They may be paid by a company, or be hobbyists.

GitHub projects also have support for Wiki pages.
