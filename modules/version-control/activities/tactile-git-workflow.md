# Tactile Git Workflow

This activity will demonstrate the Git workflow using dinosaurs and sticky notes. It covers the edit, stage, commit flow and the writing of commit messages. Advanced challenges cover selective staging and revert.


## What You Need


Each team of 1-3 people will require:
- A set of dinosaurs 
- A set of sticky notes
- 3 sheets of A4 paper
- A pen



## 1. Create your repository

Label the sheets of paper "Edit", "Staging" and "Repository" and arrange them in order.

TODO: Image



## 2. Follow an instruction set

There are easy instructions and harder instructions.

### TODO: Easy: simple edits, stage all, commit

1. _Create a red stegosarus_
2. _Create a blue t-rex_
3. `git add -a`
4. `git commit -m "Added two dinosaurs"`
5. _Change the t-rex to be yellow_
6. `git add -a`
7. `git commit -m "Changed T-Rex to yellow"`

Repo: Red Stegosaurus, Yellow T-Rex


- TODO: Medium: multiple edits, selective staging 
- TODO: Hard: discard changes, revert commit



## 3. Check your result

Check your repository's state against the demo one.
