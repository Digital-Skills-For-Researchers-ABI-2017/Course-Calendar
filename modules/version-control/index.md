# Version Control

This module will introduce you to the workflows used with the popular version control system Git. The concepts learned in this module will be applied to the management of your personal project throughout the course.




## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this module you should be able to:

- Understand the benefits of an automated version control system.
- Configure and personalize Git to suit your own preferences.
- Understand at a conceptual level how Git works; how information is stored and shared at each stage of Git's workflow.
- Create and use Git local repositories using basic tools and commands; committing files, tracking changes and restoring files. 
- Collaborate with others using remote repositories and understand the advantages of doing so. Push and pull to remote repositories. Handle conflicts and communicate with collaborators to resolve them, using Git tools and commands.

## Badges

1. ### Git Status and Logs
![Badge](images/badges/badge.png)
Given a git repository, can use git status and git log to answer questions about the number of commits, when they were made, what files are committed and what files are staged. 
_Learning outcomes: ?_

2. ### Ignoring files and folders
![Badge](images/badges/badge.png)
Given a git repository, can edit the config file to ignore all files of certain types, as well as all files contained within certain folders.
_Learning outcomes: ?_

3. ### Checking out branches
![Badge](images/badges/badge.png)
Use the log function, work out which branch to check out based on the commit comments, checkout a file, revert to the original branch, anc commit the file.
_Learning outcomes: ?_

4. ### What's Changed? Using diff
![Badge](images/badges/badge.png)
Using the log function, find out when a certain file was updated, then using diff work out exataly what changed over the different iterations. 
_Learning outcomes: ?_

5. ### Remotes in Git
![Badge](images/badges/badge.png)
Sketch outline. Have two remotes (representing two different colloboartors). Use a fetch command to get their commit history. Use diff to find out which file to commit based on some criteria, then commit that to your own branch.
_Learning outcomes: ?_

6. ### Collaborating with Git
![Badge](images/badges/badge.png)
Sketch outline. Working in pairs\group of three. Create a repository on Github. Add partners as a colloborator. First partner creates a readme file. Next partner(s) pull the fill and add content, then push it back to the remote. Now each partner introduces conflicts and the subsequent partner needs to resolve them.
