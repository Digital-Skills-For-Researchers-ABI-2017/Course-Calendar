Upon completion of this module you should be able to:

- Understand the benefits of an automated version control system.
- Be able to configure and personalize Git to suit your own pferences

- Create a local Git repository.
- Go through the modify-add-commit cycle for single and multiple files.
- Explain where information is stored at each stage of Git commit workflow.
- Identify and use Git commit numbers.
- Compare various versions of tracked files.
- Restore old versions of files.
- 
- Configure Git to ignore specific files.
- Explain why ignoring files can be useful.
- 
- Explain what remote repositories are and why they are useful.
- Clone a remote repository.
- Push to or pull from a remote repository.
- Collaborate pushing to a common repository.
- Explain what conflicts are and when they can occur.
- Resolve conflicts resulting from a merge.

- Collaborate with others using remote repositories. Push and pull to the remote repository. Handle conflicts and communicate with collaborators to resolve them, using Git tools and commands.

## Badges

1. **Git Status and Logs**
Given a git repository, can use git status and git log to answer questions about the number of commits, when they were made, what files are committed and what files are staged. 
_Learning outcomes: ?_

2. **Ignoring files and folders**
Given a git repository, can edit the config file to ignore all files of certain types, as well as all files contained within certain folders.
_Learning outcomes: ?_

3. **Checking out branches**
Use the log function, work out which branch to check out based on the commit comments, checkout a file, revert to the original branch, anc commit the file.
_Learning outcomes: ?_

4. **What's Changed? Using diff**
Using the log function, find out when a certain file was updated, then using diff work out exataly what changed over the different iterations. 
_Learning outcomes: ?_

5. **Remotes in Git**
Sketch outline. Have two remotes (representing two different colloboartors). Use a fetch command to get their commit history. Use diff to find out which file to commit based on some criteria, then commit that to your own branch.
_Learning outcomes: ?_

6. **Collaborating with Git**
Sketch outline. Working in pairs\group of three. Create a repository on Github. Add partners as a colloborator. First partner creates a readme file. Next partner(s) pull the fill and add content, then push it back to the remote. Now each partner introduces conflicts and the subsequent partner needs to resolve them.
