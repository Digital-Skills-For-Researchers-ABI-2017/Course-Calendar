## Student Task

Completion of this task demonstrates that you understand how to contribute to a project where you are not an owner or an approved contributor. Many projects are open source, and being able to submit fixes and suggestions is a key skill.

For this task you will need to find a way to contribute to a peer's project, or if you prefer then a public open source project.

The contribution may be in either the documentation or the code. It can be simple, this assessment is about the process. You may offer a bug fix, spelling corrections, better commenting, more efficient code, tidier code, or something else.

<br>

1. Use GitHub to identify a project you could contribute to.

2. Check out a copy of the project to your computer.

3. Make and commit a change.

4. Submit a pull request to the project's owner.

5. If needed, discuss the pull request with the owner via GitHub.

6. Follow through until the pull request is accepted or rejected with good reason.
