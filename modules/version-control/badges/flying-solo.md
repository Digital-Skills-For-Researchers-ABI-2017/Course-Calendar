# Flying solo
_Local-Remote Git workflow for a solo user_



## Description

Clone a repository then demonstrate committing, pushing and pulling changes.



## Student Task

This task simulates the idea of working on the same project across two computers. You may either do the task using two computers, or by duplicating the project in a second location on the same computer.

You will be assessed on your ability to use command line Git to move code between working copies of your project at different locations, and your understanding of basic commit history.

<br>

1. Clone a fresh copy of your project from GitHub to a new location on your computer.

2. Make and commit at least two separate (legitimate) changes.

3. Push your changes to GitHub.

4. Delete your duplicate repository.

5. Pull your changes into your original project.

6. Demonstrate how to identify the commits received by your pull.

7. Demonstrate how to identify the files changed by commits received.

<br>

**Note:** Step 2 (making and committing changes) may be done without observation by an assessor.




## Assessor Checklist

- Cloned an existing repository from GitHub
- Commit messages are clear and have a consistent format
- Pushed changes to GitHub successfully
- Merged changes back into original project
- Used command line Git for all above steps
- Identified the commit messages included in the pull/merge
- Identified the files changed by at least one of those commits


**Note 3:** For Step 6 and Step 7 the student may find info on what changed via command line or GitHub, the method is up to them.
