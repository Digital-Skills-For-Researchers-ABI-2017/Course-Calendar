## Student Task

This task is designed to demonstrate that you understand how to use branches to separate work and develop changes in parallel.

The branching commands are assessed by demonstration but the workflow of developing changes in parallel branches can be explained in a conversational format with your assessor.

<br>

1. Create a new feature or bugfix branch for a project task.

2. Make and commit at least two separate (legitimate) changes.

3. Explain and/or demonstrate how you would use branches to work on multiple features in parallel.

4. Merge your feature branch back into the master branch.

5. Delete the branch. 

<br>

**Note:** Step 2 (making and committing changes) may be done without observation by an assessor.
