## Student Task

This task involves steps which will create commits in your repository's history. To keep your commit history tidy, we recommend you clone a duplicate of your project for the duration of this task, and do not push any of the commits you make.

<br>

1. **Clone a fresh copy of your project** from GitHub to a new location on your computer.

2. Make some changes to your project:
  - Modify a file
  - Delete a file
  - Add a file

3. Demonstrate how you would undo these changes, resetting your project back to the state it was in when you last made a commit.

4. Make **and commit** some changes to your project:
  - Modify a file
  - Delete a file

5. Demonstrate how you would roll back the commit, resetting your project back to the state it was in at the previous commit.

6. Select a historic commit and identify what would change in your project if you were to revert it.

7. Revert the commit.

8. Demonstrate that the changes you expected were made.
