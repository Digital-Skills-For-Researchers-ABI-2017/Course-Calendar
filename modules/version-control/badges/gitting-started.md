# Gitting Started
_Tracking Projects with Git_

## Description

Use command line Git to create a new repository with a readme file, licence and gitignore. Additionally, publish the repository to GitHub.




## Student Task

1. Create a local repository called `gitting-started`. The project should contain:
- a Python script which prints "Gitting Started!" when run from the shell.
- a README file which describes the project name and purpose.
- a LICENCE file describing a relevant licence

2. Configure the repository to prevent the user from committing any files with the extension `pycache`.

3. Publish the repository to your personal GitHub account.

as this is outside the scope of assessment for this badge.
