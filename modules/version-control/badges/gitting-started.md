---


## Student Task

1. Create a local repository called `gitting-started`. The project should contain:
  **- a Python script** which prints "Gitting Started!" when run from the shell.
  **- a README file** which describes the project name and purpose.
  **- a LICENCE file** describing a relevant licence

2. Configure the repository to prevent the user from committing any files with the extension `pycache`.

3. Publish the repository to your personal GitHub account.
