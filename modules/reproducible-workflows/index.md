# Reproducible Workflows

This module will introduce you to how to conduct your research in a reproducible way. As you are aware, reproducability is a core tenet of science. So far inthis course you have learnt a number of tools (shell, Git, Python) that will help you work in a reproducible way. Automating your workflow with these tools will help increase the speed at which you work, and decrease the number of errors you make.
